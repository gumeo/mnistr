# mnistr

This package serves the purpose of making it easy to get started with the mnist data set in R. This is currently **work in progress** and I plan to work on this in my free-time. The main goals of this package are:

- Download mnist from R into specified or current directory
- Load mnist into R 
- Basic plotting functions for digits
- Simple neural network to train on the data, inspired by [this implementation](http://briandolhansky.com/blog/2014/10/30/artificial-neural-networks-matrix-form-part-5)

If the download function cannot unzip the data, then you have to do it manually.

If there is any relevant content for this package, I am more likely to put it on my [blog](gumeo.github.io). I'll post a link of relevant links to blogposts here below.
