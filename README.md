# mnistr

This package serves the purpose of making it easy to get started with the mnist data set in R. This is currently **work in progress** and I plan to work on this in my free-time. The main goals of this package are:

- Download mnist from R
- Load mnist from R
- Basic plotting functions for digits
- Simple neural network to train and visualize results

If the download function cannot unzip the data, then you have to do it manually.

If there is any relevant content for this package, I am more likely to put it on my [blog](gumeo.github.io). I'll post a link of relevant links to blogposts here below.
