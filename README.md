# mnistr

This package serves the purpose of making it easy to get started with the mnist data set in R. This is currently **work in progress** and I plan to work on this in my free-time. The main goals of this package are:

- Download mnist from R
- Load mnist from R
- Basic plotting functions for digits
- Other interesting plotting functions

I plan on releasing some R notebooks as tutorials on how to do some basic ML on the mnist data set in R, and use this package to do some simple visualizations.

I am uncertain if the dataset can be wrapped into a package, that's why the download solution is being used now. I intent to inspect further whether I can add the data set directly to the package.

I'll keep this *README* updated with the progress.
